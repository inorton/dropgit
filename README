DropGit v0.0.1 - (c) 2009 Ian Norton <inorton@gmail.com>
----------------------------------------------------------

What is DropGit?
-----------------

DropGit simply gives you a magic folder where whatever you place 
inside gets versioned and backed-up automatically to a remote 
server (under your control) via ssh.

What Do I need?
----------------

perl    5.6 or later
iwatch  0.2.1 or later
git     1.6.x or later
ssh

You also should have setup password-less ssh access to the server you intend to 
use as the remote repository for your DropGit, You might just create an 
ssh-identity with no password or might make use of other tools like seahorse to
protect your ssh private key.

Installation
-------------

run "make install" as root

Setup Your DropGit folder
--------------------------

You may be prompted for your ssh user or key password if you have not setup ssh key based authentication, please get that working well first.

run:
$ dropgit_setup -l ~/Desktop/DropGit -r username@myserver.hostname:DropGit


Seahorse / Gnome Integration
-----------------------------

ensure you have seahorse installed and then run:
$ gnome-session-properties

Find the entry for Seahorse-agent and then change the command line to be:-

"seahorse-agent --execute dropgit_monitor"

Logout, then login again and dropgit should be autostarted
